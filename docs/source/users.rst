Superuser
==========

The IDEAL Superuser is a local administrator.

The main responsibility of a Superuser is to approve new studies and new user accounts. They can equally invite new users.

Although able to approve and create a new study, the Superuser does not have direct access to the patient information of a study. Therefore, they are not able to import a study patient list. Equally, the Superuser is not able to do the IDEAL linkage between the patients in the carecenter/study.
