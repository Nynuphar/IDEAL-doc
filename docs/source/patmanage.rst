Patient management: from adding a patient to a study to editing this patient information
###########################################################################################

Add a patient to an ongoing study
**************************************

Now let's try to add a new patient to a already ongoing study (Merengues and Cream, for example). You can do this by adding these patients manually be searching on the patient list from the hospital as mentioned above. For this, please navigate to "**Patient management**", and then to "**Add patient to a study**".

Here you will be prompted to add a patient either from the local Hospital/Carecenter or add this patient manually.

Here, search the patient you want to add in "**Hospital Patient**", as shown below for the patient "Paul Klee".

.. note:: In this search area, you have access to the patients in the Hospital. In order to search for these patients, IDEAL has to be connected to the Hospital database and will be regularly updated.


When selecting "Paul Klee" (just by right clicking on it), the patient information available in the hospital database will be automatically "added" to the "Study patient" field, as shown below.

Here you will have to select the "**Study**" to which you'll be adding this patient, and add the "**Study Patient ID**". 

Then by scrolling to the bottom of the page, select "**Save**" and the patient is added to the study and will appear in the "**Patients List**".

.. warning:: Remember that not all IDEAL users are able to search for patients in the Hospital database. Check more information on :doc:`users`.

Edit a patient from the study
*******************************

Sometimes errors might be introduced when creating the CSV file with the Study patients. This is the case of the example below:

This dummy patient called Elsie-Mae Gardiner had the wrong year of birth on the study file (1931 instead of 1930). 
In order to update the Study details, you can navigate to "**Patients**" and then to "**Patients List**". Here you can use this icon in the same row as the patient you want to edit, as shown below:

And make your changes as shown below as well (in the Study table, and don't forget to **Save**):

.. note:: Note how Elsie-Mae Gardiner still got linked by IDEAL despite the small change in the year of birth (all the other information was the same)!

.. warning:: Before updating any patient information make sure that this information is correct!
