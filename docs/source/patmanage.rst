Patient management: add a patient to a study
###########################################################################################

Add a patient to an ongoing study
**************************************

Now let's try to add a new patient to an already onboarded study on IDEAL (for example, Merengues and Cream). You can do this by searching these patients on the patient list from the hospital database and add them manually. Just navigate to "**Patient management**", and then to "**Add patient to a study**".

Here you will be prompted to add a patient either from the local Hospital/Carecenter or add this patient manually.

Select "**Add patient**", to search on the Hospital database, for example the patient "Paul Klee".

.. note:: In this search area, you have access to the patients in the Hospital. To search for these patients, IDEAL must be connected to the Hospital database and will be regularly updated.


When selecting "Paul Klee" (just by right clicking on it), the patient information available in the hospital database will be automatically "added" to the "Study patient" field, as shown below.

Here you will have to select the "**Study**" to which you'll be adding this patient, and add the "**Study Patient ID**". 

Then by scrolling to the bottom of the page, select "**Save**" and the patient is added to the study and will appear in the "**Patients List**".

.. warning:: Remember that not all IDEAL users are able to search for patients in the Hospital database. Check more information on :doc:`users`.
