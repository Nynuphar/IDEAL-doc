Troubleshooting IDEAL
##########################

Bulk patient import shows an error
*************************************

The most common error will be that the format of your CSV file does not match the format IDEAL expects to read. See doc:`users`, specfically `Define the data format of a study <https://nynuphar-ideal-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/study.html#define-the-data-format-of-a-study/>`_.

Manually adding a patient from the Hospital database to a study
*******************************************************************

Here do not forget to go "**Patients**" and then "**Create patient**" to search for the patient to be added. Once you found the patient, select the patient and don't forget to add the *Study Patient ID* before saving.
