File export
##############

Currently only an **IDEAL manager** and **IDEAL superuser** can export the log files.

To export the log files go to "**Studies**" and then "**Log file export**".

.. note:: files in 2 different formats are generated: .pdf and .csv

There are 3 types of log files which can be exported (an example of each file is shown below):

1) Export subject identification log



2) Export screening log
3) Export subject linking log
