Tasks to manage appointments
###############################

Creating appointments automatically creates an associated task
*******************************************************************

When a patient appointment is created, a task is automatically created per each appointment. *Tasks* help manage the appointments and keep track of the different tasks, for example, call the patient to confirm the appointment, discuss with the doctors which exams need to be performed upon the visit, etc. You can also keep track of the appointment status (*to do*, *in progress* and *done*).

How to access tasks

There are 3 different ways to access tasks:

* via the `Calendar`_
* via the `Appointments list`_
* via the `Task list`_

All of these will show the following display:

The task *specific for each appointment* is shown in the top right corner (blue blox): here, you can set the status of this task, the due date, any comment and the responsible user.

The area *Patient tasks* (pink box) allows to visualize all the appointments of this specific patient (in this case Cristiano Ronaldo) and to navigate between appointments by just clicking in the different appointmments. The highlighted appointment in grey quickly shows the appointment which is being visualized. This section also allows to have a quick overview of the tasks for each appointment.
