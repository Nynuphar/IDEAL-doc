Tasks to manage appointments
###############################

Creating appointments automatically creates an associated task
*******************************************************************

When a patient appointment is created, a task is automatically created per each appointment. *Tasks* help manage the appointments and keep track of the different tasks, for example, call the patient to confirm the appointment, discuss with the doctors which exams need to be performed upon the visit, etc.
