IDEAL linkage study - hospital

Linkage
*********

After bulk import of your study patients (see :doc:`study`), IDEAL will automatically link the patients from your study with the patients from the hospital.

Here for example, 100 patients were imported and from these, 80 had an immediate match with the hospital patients, while 14 "similar pairs" were linked.

"Similar pairs" likely have some similarity conflicts, but were still close enough to be considered a match.

We will look at some examples of "similar pairs" below, but first let's navigate to our study and have an overview of the patients.

..warning::
  If you get an error message when importing your patients to a study, please check either this section :doc:`trouble` or this :doc:`study`.

Study overview after patient import and linkage
******************************************************

By navigating to the area "**Patients**" and then to "**Patients List**", you can see here the patients which were imported to your study (in my case the study TJP100).

When hovering over the different icons on the right, you can see different functions - see below.

..note::
  For a linked patient, the icon "**Link patient**" will be displayed in gray, while a non-linked patient will be displayed in white.

Linkage examples
******************

In this case, this patient has been recorded in the hospital database with two first names "Donald Timothy", while in the study he was introduced as only "Timothy".

However, because the rest of the information (surname, date of birth) is the same, the similarity is good enough for IDEAL to link them as a pair.

Similarly in the case below, the patient "Jennyfer Vengerberg" had been recorded as only "Jen" instead of "Jennyfer" in the study. As the rest of the information is the same, this patient was still correctly linked.
