Linkage
*********

After bulk import of your study patients (see :doc:`study`), IDEAL will automatically link the patients from your study with the patients from the hospital.

Here for example, 100 patients were imported and from these, 80 had an immediate match with the hospital patients, while 14 "similar pairs" were linked.

"Similar pairs" likely have some similarity conflicts, but were still close enough to be considered a match.

See some of the examples below:
