Appointments
##############

Appointments are subdivided into 2 sections:

#. "**Appointment schedules**" under the "**Study**" section: here you can create an apointment schedule for a study. This should be decided at at the **beginning** of the study and **before** starting to book appointments.

#. "**Apointments**" under the "**Study patients**" section to create appointments for specific patients.

Let's look at these points in more detail.

Book an appointment schedule
*******************************

.. warning:: Please set the appointment schedule at the *beginning* of the study, before starting to book the appointments for the different patients.

.. note: do not forget to select a study beforehand.

To create an appointment schedule navigate to: **Appointment schedules** > **Create Appointment Schedule**.

Here you can specify different things:

* Types of appointments: *screening, randomization, enrolment, follow-up* and *unplanned*
* Days from day 1: when patient joins the study
* Duration: duration of the appointment - this is only relevant when booking the actual/definitive appointment, but it can be edited after. The *default* option is 00:30:00 (30 minutes)
* Day range: this is the tolerance range to book the actual/definitive appointment. It will be calculated around the *days from day 1*. The *default* option is 4 days and the *maximum* amount of days is 10.
